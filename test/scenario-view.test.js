// test/scenario-view.test.js — the Scenario planner's day chart rendered under a
// small DOM shim. Two things it pins, both from 22 Sep 2026:
//
//   1. A cycle's labour is drawn at the minute she really works it, and it is
//      never thinner inside the bar than the same job is on the person row
//      below it. Drawn one pixel wide, the fold landed exactly on the seam
//      between two cycles and read as that seam rather than as her working there.
//
//   2. The button that applies the ladder sits on the climb card's own heading.
//      A day of nine modules makes a nine-rung ladder, and a control she has to
//      scroll past all of it to reach is a control that has gone missing.
