// Her words: __"i need something like category for product on POINT. 1st level 2nd level, 3rd
// level....example top level is Penang Island & Prai. Under Penang Island will be Area like Sg Ara,
// Balik Pulau, Farlim, Georgetown"__.
//
// This file judges the MODEL and nothing else — no screen, no publish. Three things are worth
// pinning, and each is a way of being confidently wrong:
//
//   1. NOTHING MOVES ON THE DAY IT ARRIVES. A Point she has never dragged has no `sort`, and an
//      absent sort must rank LAST, not first — `Number(null)` and `Number("")` are both 0, so the
//      naive version would lift every untouched Point above one she had deliberately put on top.
//   2. A POINT IS NEVER LOST BY ITS AREA. Deleting an area, or a hand-edited `areaId` naming
//      something that is not there, must drop the Point into the unfiled block — which is drawn
//      FIRST, because it is a real place a customer can go.
//   3. AN EDIT MUST NOT WIPE WHAT THE FORM DOES NOT ASK ABOUT. `updatePoint` takes a whole draft,
//      so a caller handing over the editor's own fields would otherwise clear her area, her order
//      and the address switch in silence.
//
