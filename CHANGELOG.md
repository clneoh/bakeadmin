# Jienluv2bake — change history (v54 → v62)

What changed in each version of the backoffice app, newest first. Each version
number is the "Engine" you can see on the app's **More** screen, so you can
always tell which build a phone is running.

## v62 — "Not sharing" strip + read-only View (8 Sep 2026)
When a phone is not on the shared cloud — shared data off, never set up, or
signed out — a thin amber strip at the very top of every screen reads **"⚠ Not
sharing right now"** with a one-line reason and a **Fix it** tap straight to
Settings → Shared data. It never locks the app, and it disappears on its own the
moment sharing is back on. (Set up once per phone: no SQL — the shared-data
setup from v53 does everything.)

Also, every backup copy in Settings → **Backup & safety** now has a **View**
button: a purely read-only look inside that copy — its orders grouped by
delivery date (customer, product, quantity, status), the product price list and
ingredient stock at that time. Looking at a June price confirms the detail
without moving today: no rewind, nothing written, ever.

## v61 — Cloud backups (8 Sep 2026)
Every time the app opens while signed in, it quietly saves a full **Daily**
copy (first open each day), a **Weekly** copy (Mondays) and a **Monthly** copy
(the 1st) to your own Supabase cloud, keeping the newest 7 daily / 4 weekly /
3 monthly. A "Back up to cloud now" button, and one "Before restore" copy
saved before every restore, stay until you delete them. Each copy can be
**Restored** (steps the phone — and the shared cloud — back to that copy; a
"Before restore" copy is always saved first, so it is never one-way),
**Downloaded** as `jienluv2bake-backup-YYYY-MM-DD-KIND.json` (which re-imports
like an Export), or **Deleted**. Lives under More → Settings → "Backup &
safety". The copies never contain the per-phone app-login email/password or
the app password. Setup: run `supabase/backups.sql` once.

## v60 — Homepage customer reviews (8 Sep 2026)
Customers can leave a **What customers say** review on the homepage — name,
1–5 stars, a message in English / 中文 / Bahasa Malaysia, and an optional
photo. Every review lands *unpublished* in More → Reviews, where **Publish**
shows it on the homepage, **Take down** hides it, and **Delete** removes it —
nothing becomes public until you tap Publish. Reviews appear on the homepage
only. Setup: run `supabase/reviews.sql` once.

## v59 — Occasion import tidy-up (8 Sep 2026)
Added **World Animal Day** (4 Oct) to the fun/pet-day import, plus
whole-group ticking — tick a heading box, or use **Untick all / Tick all**.

## v58 — Occasion import (8 Sep 2026)
A one-tap **＋ Add occasion** import of Malaysia's days plus fun days (pet,
baking, kindness), and a **My own day** quick-add.

## v57 — Private notes per product ingredient (8 Sep 2026)
Each ingredient line in a product can carry a short private description *for
that product only* (e.g. which flour that product uses). Typed and seen on the
Products screens only — never on the shop, a label, or the product cards.

## v56 — "Keep at least" reserve (8 Sep 2026)
Ingredients can set a **Keep at least** level. The order list tops an
ingredient back up to that level in whole packs when your stock drops more
than 10% under it, and low items ride along even when today's bakes don't use
them. The Ingredients screen shows a red low-stock strip. Guide synced to v56.

## v55 — Time & length units (7 Sep 2026)
**min/hr** and **cm/m** are pre-loaded in Units (under More), like g/kg — so
bake times and pan sizes can be measured and converted (1 hr = 60 min,
1 m = 100 cm). Baking stock is guarded so a time or length unit can never
distort a gram count.

## v54 — Ingredients on hand (7 Sep 2026)
Ingredients now have **On hand** stock. The PO buys only what you don't have
(rows you already have drop out), "Bought" on a saved list adds its packs
once, and marking an order **Baked** subtracts its ingredients (undo restores
them).

*This history covers the two-phone cloud era (v54+). Earlier versions
(pre-v54) can be added the same way — ask and I'll extend it. Each new
version (v63…) is added here as it ships.*
