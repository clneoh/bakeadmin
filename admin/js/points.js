// points.js — a Self collection Point: a place a customer can collect from that is NOT
// the bakery (4 Oct 2026).
//
// ★ HER TERM, AND THE TRAP IT AVOIDS. It is a "Self collection Point" and NEVER a "pickup
// point". `settings.pickupPlace` already exists (v188) and is the exact OPPOSITE end of the
// trip — the bakery's OWN door, where a courier collects FROM. A customer's end called
// "pickup" too would be two halves of one journey sharing a name. She called this out
// herself: "we should call that Self collection Point, not pickup point which is confusing."
//
// ★ THE KITCHEN IS NOT A POINT. Collecting from the bakery is already `fulfillment:
// "collect"` with no point on the order, and it stays exactly what it is: free, no minimum,
// always offered, needing no record of any kind. THIS MODULE KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT THE
// KITCHEN, and that is the design — the difference between "collect from us" and "collect
// from a Point" falls out of the model rather than needing a special case. Giving the
// kitchen a Point record would be the mistake: it would inherit a fee it must not have, a
// provider who does not exist, and a life it can never end.
//
// ★ SHE OPENS THEM ONE AT A TIME, AND EXPECTS MOST TO END. Her words: "baker will open
// collection point one by one, with a budget to spend, if after a period of time and the
// justification is not there then baker will decide to de-activate that point, and not
// likely will open all point one go." So each Point is INDEPENDENT — nothing here assumes
// the others exist — and Pause is a normal ending, not a failure.
//
// A Point is deliberately a RECORD and not a setting: a list she grows, like the credits
// ledger and the promo codes, so it travels between her phones the same way (see sync.js).
//
// Pure: no DOM, no storage. Runs under Node for tests.

//
// ⚠️ THE SHOP IS PUBLIC. It gets the id and the NAME — enough for a customer to choose where
// to collect — and NOTHING ELSE. **The receiver's name, their phone and the fee are hers.**
// Publishing them would put a private person's mobile number on a page anyone can read, and
// the fee is what she pays out, not a price. This is the same rule the promo code's `holder`
// follows (v289): the name of whoever a thing belongs to is never published.
//
// The ADDRESS is not published either, though a customer does need it — because the message
// that tells them where to go is built from HER OWN copy of the Point, not from the shop's.
// The shop only has to say which Places there are; the telling is hers.
//
// ACTIVE Points only, and always sent even when empty: the published payload replaces the
// whole row, so an absent key would leave the shop offering yesterday's Points. Same reason
// the occasions, the categories and the promo codes are sent the same way.
export function publishPoints(state, points) {
  // ⚠️ `min` IS PUBLISHED AND THE RECEIVER'S NAME, PHONE AND FEE ARE NOT (v306). The rule this
  // list has followed since v299 is that nothing PRIVATE leaves her app — a public page has no
  // login, so the person who receives there must never be named on it. A smallest basket is the
  // opposite of private: it is exactly what the customer has to know before they choose, and
  // without it the shop could only take an order the Point does not want. It is sent as a plain
  // number, 0 for "no minimum", so the shop never has to read a missing key as a rule.
  //
  // ★★ AND `isKitchen` IS PUBLISHED NOW TOO (v407), which is a narrower thing than it looks.
  // ⚠️⚠️ IT IS NOT A FACT ABOUT HER, IT IS A FACT ABOUT THE PAGE. Since v406 the kitchen IS a Point
  // she marks, but the shop had no way to know which one — so it went on printing its OWN
  // "Our kitchen" row above the list, and **the moment she marked a kitchen a customer saw her
  // kitchen twice**: once invented, once under the name she gave it, as two different choices that
  // looked like two different places. ⭐ A boolean saying "this is the bakery's own kitchen" is
  // exactly as public as the name it sits beside, and it is the smallest thing that lets the shop
  // stop inventing a row — see store/app.js, where the invented row is now the FALLBACK for the
  // day she has not marked one, which is the job it was always meant to do.
  //
  // ★★ AND THE ADDRESS NOW RIDES WITH IT — BUT ONLY WHEN SHE SAYS SO (v410). Her words: __"in point
  // card, a switch to on/off address to be shown or not"__.
  // ⚠️⚠️ THE STREET ADDRESS IS THE MOST PRIVATE THING ON THIS RECORD, and it has never once left
  // her app. It leaves now, for the Points she ticks and no others, and ⚠️ **only `address` is
  // published — never the receiver's name or their phone**, which is what would put a private
  // person's mobile number on a page anyone can read.
  // ⚠️ WRITTEN ONLY WHEN THE SWITCH IS ON **and** there is something to say: a ticked Point with
  // no address typed publishes byte-for-byte what it published yesterday, so the switch alone can
  // never change a page.
  //
  // ⚠️ THE SECOND ARGUMENT IS THE ORDER, AND IT IS THE SHOP'S (v410). The customer page walks the
  // published list in order and puts an area heading in front of the first Point under it, so the
  // order and the headings have to be ONE decision — taken in pointAreas.js `shopPointOrder`, and
  // handed in here. Left out, the list is `activePoints` as it has always been.
