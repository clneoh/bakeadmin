// views/points.js — the Self collection Points card (v298).
//
// HER SCOPE, and it is deliberately small: "we just need to have a card for points". One
// card, listing the Points, where she can add one, edit one, pause one, bring one back and
// delete one. There is no dashboard, no cost-against-value panel and no budget — all three
// were drawn once and withdrawn. See js/points.js for the model and for why a Point is not
// a "pickup point" and not the kitchen.
//
// Same shape as Parcel couriers / Suppliers / Ingredients: an always-on "New Point" card at
// the top, one row per Point below it, and a single editor pop-up shared by New and Edit.
//
// ⚠️ NO MINIMUM ORDER. She first chose one, then said keep it simple — so a Point carries
// no basket rule at all. Collecting is free; the fee on this card is what SHE pays the
// provider, not what a customer pays her. Do not add a minimum back without her asking.
